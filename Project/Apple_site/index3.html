                    of smartphones, which run the iOS operating system. The first iPhone was unveiled by Steve
                    Jobs on January 9, 2007. Since then, new iPhone models have been released every year. When
                    it was introduced, its
                    multi-touch screen was described as "revolutionary" and a "game-changer" for the mobile
                    phone industry. The device has been credited with creating the app economy. iOS is one of
                    the two major smartphone platforms in the world, alongside Android. The iPhone has
                    generated large profits for the company,
                    and is credited with helping to make Apple one of the world's most valuable publicly
                    traded companies.[189] As of the end of 2024, the iPhone accounts for nearly half of the
                    company's revenue.[1]</p>

          <p><b>Main article: iPad</b>The iPad is Apple's line of tablets which run iPadOS. The
                    first-generation iPad was announced on January 27, 2010. The iPad is mainly marketed for
                    consuming multimedia, creating art, working on documents, videoconferencing, and playing
                    games. The iPad lineup consists of several base iPad models, and the smaller iPad Mini,
                    upgraded iPad Air, and high-end iPad Pro. Apple has consistently improved the iPad's
                    performance, with the iPad Pro adopting the same M1
                    and M2 chips as the Mac; but the iPad still receives criticism for its limited
                    OS.[190][191]</p>

          <h2>Stores</h2>

          <p>The first Apple Stores were originally opened as two locations in May 2001 by then-CEO Steve
                    Jobs,[88] after years of attempting but failing store-within-a-store concepts.[89] Seeing
                    a need for improved retail presentation of the company's products, he began an effort in
                    1997 to revamp the retail program to get an improved relationship to consumers, and hired
                    Ron Johnson in 2000.[89] Jobs relaunched Apple's online store in 1997,[219] and opened the
                    first two physical stores in 2001.[88] The media initially speculated that Apple would
                    fail,[90] but its stores were highly successful, exceeding the sales numbers of competing
                    nearby stores, and within three years reached US$1 billion in annual sales, becoming the
                    fastest retailer in history to do so.[90</p>

          <h2>Privacy</h2>

          <p>Apple has publicly taken a pro-privacy stance, actively making privacy-conscious features and
                    settings part of its conferences, promotional campaigns, and public image.[230] With its
                    iOS 8 mobile operating system in 2014, the company started encrypting all contents of iOS
                    devices through users' passcodes, making it impossible at the time for the company to
